Learning Shiny
===

My goal is understand and training Shiny web applications developed with Rstudio.

## Run with ```runGitHub() ```

You can run apps of this repository choosing the subidir of your choice. 
For now, only "01 - BNDES" is available, so the script for this app is:

```
shiny::runGitHub(repo = "Learning_Shiny", username = "RafaelEstatistico", 
                 subdir = "01 - BNDES")
```
**Note: please check if all packages are installed and if R is in a recent version**
